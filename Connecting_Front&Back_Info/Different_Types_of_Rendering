Different Types of Rendering
Rendering is the aspect of web development concerned with translating code into a visual and interactive website. The browser uses HTML and CSS to build a render tree. We can think of the render tree as a blueprint for the page view that the user eventually sees.

There are different ways to render a web app. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks, and we choose a rendering method depending on our priorities: SEO, user experience, and performance. In this lesson, we’ll discuss client-side and server-side rendering.

In client-side rendering, the content of the page is dynamically generated in the browser as the user navigates the app. Alternatively, in server-side rendering, the server generates the content and sends it to the browser, on-demand. We can also combine client-side and server-side rendering to use hybrid-rendering to incorporate the advantages of both. In hybrid-rendering, static content is generated on the server, while dynamic content is generated on the client-side as the user navigates the site.

We’ll go into more detail on client-side rendering and server-side rendering in the upcoming exercises.

How does client-side rendering differ from server-side rendering?
    With client-side rendering, content is dynamically generated in the browser. With server-side rendering content is generated on the server, then sent to the browser to be rendered.
