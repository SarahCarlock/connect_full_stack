What is a XSS Attack
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack is a type of attack where code is injected into a legitimate and trusted website.

There are three main types of XSS Attacks:

Stored XSS Attacks:

In a Stored XSS Attack, the attacker locates a vulnerability in a web application and injects a malicious script into its server. That code would be then stored in the app’s database, and when a user makes a request to view that type of content, the code stored is then executed.

In this case, we can use specific HTTP Headers and data sanitization to stop any malicious code from reaching the server.

Reflected XSS Attacks:

In a Reflected XSS Attack, an application receives potentially malicious data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.

Similar to Stored XSS Attacks, we can also use HTTP Headers and sanitization in order to protect any malicious code from being injected.

DOM-Based XSS Attacks:

In a DOM-Based XSS Attack, the attack is executed entirely in the browser by modifying the DOM (Document Object Model).

In order to protect one’s code from a DOM-Based XSS attack, one must be careful of the JavaScript that is used on the front end.
